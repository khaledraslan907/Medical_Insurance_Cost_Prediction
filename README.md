# Medical_Insurance_Cost_Prediction
Medical Insurance Cost Prediction project using Ridge Regression
This project involves predicting medical insurance costs using a Ridge Regression model. The dataset used contains various features that can influence medical insurance costs, and the goal is to leverage these features to make accurate predictions.
# Project Overview:
# 1- Loading the Dataset: 
The dataset is loaded using the pandas library. This step involves reading the dataset file into a DataFrame, allowing for easy manipulation and analysis.
# 2- Exploring and Describing the Data:
Several methods are employed to understand the dataset better as head, tail, shape, describe and info.
# 3- Data Analysis:
The data is analyzed using visualizations created with Seaborn and Matplotlib:
countplot(): Used to show the counts of observations in each categorical bin using bars.
distplot(): Used to plot the distribution of a univariate variable.
# 4- Data Pre-processing:
Categorical features in the dataset are encoded using the LabelEncoder method. This converts categorical variables into a numerical format, which is required for the regression model.
# 5- Splitting the Data:
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. This step is crucial for evaluating the performance of the model on unseen data.
# 6- Applying Polynomial Features:
Polynomial features are generated to capture the nonlinear relationships between the features and the target variable. This is achieved using the PolynomialFeatures class from sklearn.
# 7- Building and Training the Ridge Regression Model:
A Ridge Regression model (L2 regularization) is built and trained on the training set. Ridge Regression is used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients.
# 8- Model Evaluation:
The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). These metrics help in understanding how well the model is performing in predicting medical insurance costs.
